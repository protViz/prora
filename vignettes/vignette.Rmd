# Abstract

A plethora of R packages exist on CRAN and Bioconductor to perform over-representation 
analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). However, consistency in the 
underlying nomenclature for specific analyses and user friendly implementation is 
still lacking. _prora_ aims at unifying ID mapping and enrichment analysis 
in a syntactically coherent and intuitive way, while ensuring reproducibility of 
results. _prora_ primarily consists of wrapper functions around the 
_sigora_ and _WebGestaltR_ packages from CRAN and 
_rmarkdown_ based reports for visualisation and contextualisation 
of analysis results.



# Introduction

Methods to identify differentially regulated pathways among a vast background of
quantified genes or proteins differ in complexity of the underlying algorithms 
and computations, ranging from the application of Fisher's exact test in ORA and
extensions to gene pairs [@Foroushani2013] to more complex statistical procdures
in gene set enrichment analysis [@Subramanian15545] and network based procedures
[@glaab2012enrichnet]. Almost all methods come with their own implementation as 
an _R_ package, _i.e._ ORA in both _sigora_ and 
_WebGestaltR_, network based gene enrichment analysis in 
_enrichnet_ and the list keeps going on. Naturally, different 
implementations come with different -- and often inconsistent -- features, such 
as ID mapping or demand a lot of knowledge from the user in setting up appropriate
data structures and other preconditions. `prora` aims at providing a 
consistent and user friendly interface, which will be introduced in the following 
section. Elaborating on the methodological and statistical aspects of the underlying 
methods is beyond the scope of this vignette and the reader is referred to the 
publications in the reference section.

# Installation and loading

After installing the packages from _Bioconductor_ as shown below, the package 
can be loaded using `library(prora)`.

```{r installing, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("prora")
library(prora)
```

# Example workflow

We shall analyse proteomic data with the following format:

```{r exampleContrastData}
data("exampleContrastData")
#glimpse(exampleContrastData)
```

The first column `protein_Id` contains FASTA formatted human protein accessions 
and the second column fold change estimates. _e.g._ as obtained by a 
`limma::toptable()` call. The first step is now to translate the FASTA headers 
into Uniprot accessions for subsequent ID mapping.

```{r getUniprot}
dd <- prora::get_UniprotID_from_fasta_header(exampleContrastData)
#glimpse(dd)
```

We see that we have lost `r nrow(exampleContrastData) - nrow(dd)` accessions 
which did not correspond to a FASTA format. Now we apply ORA, sigORA and GSEA to
the obtained ranked protein list. To apply sigORA and ORA one must first compute 
the background GPS repository using `makeGPS_wrappR()`. The advantage is that 
backgrounds can be specified separately for each experiment or combined for several 
batches of experiments. However, computing the accession pair signatures and 
calculating their respective weights is computationally intensive and potentially 
time consuming.

```{r makeGPS_wrappR, results='hide'}
data("idmap", package = "sigora")
myGPSrepo <- makeGPS_wrappR(ids = dd$UniprotID, target = "GO")


res <- sigoraWrappR(data =  dd,
                    threshold = 0.2,
                    score_col = "estimate",
                    GPSrepos = myGPSrepo$gps,
                    greater_than = TRUE)
```

The result of `sigoraWrappR()` is a list containing the sigORA and ORA results 
along with user specified inputs that will be used in the reports described in 
section \@ref(reports).

```{r peaknames}
names(res)
```

Under the hood a lot of ID mapping has taken place of which the user is unaware. 
To check the ID mapping efficiency when mapping Uniprot IDs to GO, KEGG or ENTREZ 
accessions the package comes with a `checkIDmappingEfficiency()` function to 
check the number of lost IDs.

```{r checkIDmappingEfficiency}
checkIDmappingEfficiency(dd$UniprotID, keytype = "UNIPROT") %>% 
  round(2)
```

Evidently, the mapping from Uniprot to KEGG IDs seems to be fairly inefficient 
and results should be interpreted with care.

# Reports

Good reporting and reproducibility of all intermediate and final results is key
to good scientific practice. In this spirit, `prora` provides a reproducible, 
_rmarkdown_ based reports for each method. To highlight the most 
important targets, settings and parameters, a walkthrough is given in this part 
of the vignette.

To run all methods and produce the reports on the example data from the prior 
section, the following parameters must be set in advance.

```{r runSigora}
organism <- "hsapiens" # Organism to which the FASTA headers correspond
ID_col <- "UniprotID" # Column containing the IDs
fc_col <- "estimate" # Column containing the estimates (in this case log fold changes)
target_GSEA <- c( # all possible targets for GSEA
  "geneontology_Biological_Process",
  "geneontology_Cellular_Component",
  "geneontology_Molecular_Function"
)
target_SIGORA <- # all possible targets for sigORA
  c("GO", "KEGG", "reactome")
fc_threshold <- 0.5 # threshold for ORA methods
greater <- TRUE # direction of the threshold
nperm <- 10 # number of permutations used to compute enrichment scores in GSEA
odir <- "tmp" # output directory to write all reports
```

To iterate over all possible target directly, the following workflow functions 
can be used. They take the above specified parameters as inputs and facilitate 
the enrichment analysis workflows tremendously. The results will be saved to the
specified output directory with a subfolder for each method and target.

The following code chunk iterates the `runGSEA()` function over all possible 
GSEA target databases. Internally, `runGSEA()` calls `WebGestaltR()` for the 
analysis and compiles `prora's` in the same output directory.

```{r runGSEA ,eval=FALSE}
sapply(target_GSEA, function(x) {
  runWebGestaltGSEA(
    data = dd,
    fpath = "",
    ID_col = ID_col,
    score_col = fc_col,
    organism = organism,
    target = x,
    nperm = nperm,
    outdir = file.path(odir, "WebGestaltGSEA")
  )
})
```

Analogously, `runWebGestaltORA()` and `runSIGORA()` embody a whole workflow 
and save nicely formatted results to the output directory.

```{r runWebGestaltORA,eval=FALSE}
sapply(target_GSEA, function(x) {
  runWebGestaltORA(
    data = dd,
    fpath = "",
    organism = organism,
    ID_col = ID_col,
    target = x,
    threshold = fc_threshold,
    greater = greater,
    nperm = nperm,
    score_col = fc_col,
    outdir = file.path(odir, "WebGestaltORA")
  )
})
```

`runSIGORA()` calls the `sigoraWrappR()` function which was introduced in 
section \@ref(Example workflow) and compiles the built-in report. 

```{r runSIGORA,eval=FALSE}
sapply(target_SIGORA, function(x) {
  runSIGORA(
    data = dd,
    target = x,
    score_col = fc_col,
    threshold = fc_threshold,
    greater = greater,
    outdir = file.path(odir, "sigORA")
  )
})
```

In the following the `runGSEA()` function's inner workings will be discussed in 
more detail. After creating the output directory `outdir` the provided data is 
fed into _WebGestaltR_'s `WebGestaltR(..., enrichMethod = "GSEA")`. 
The results are then used to generate the report provided by the `prora` 
package^[The source files for all reports can be found in 
`system.file("rmarkdown_reports", package = "fgczgseaora")`]. All `WebGestaltR` 
and `prora` results can then be found in the output directory.

# Command line tools

The enrichment methods in this package (ORA, GSEA sigORA) come with a 
_docopt_ based command line tool to facilitate analysing batches of
files^[Those scripts can be found in 
`system.file("run_scripts", package = "prora")`]. 
The main advantage of docopt is that all tools have to come with a thorough 
documentation where it is also possible to provide default values. For running 
GSEA, the command line tool is:

```{r commandLineexample, eval=FALSE}
"WebGestaltR GSEA for multigroup reports

Usage:
  lfq_multigroup_gsea.R <grp2file> [--organism=<organism>] [--outdir=<outdir>] [--idtype=<idtype>] [--ID_col=<ID_col>]  [--nperm=<nperm>] [--score_col=<score_col>] [--contrast=<contrast>]

Options:
  -o --organism=<organism> organism [default: hsapiens]
  -r --outdir=<outdir> output directory [default: results_gsea]
  -t --idtype=<idtype> type of id used for mapping [default: uniprotswissprot]
  -i --ID_col=<ID_col> Column containing the UniprotIDs [default: UniprotID]

  -c --contrast=<contrast> column containing fold changes [default: contrast]

It can be run using the following command in a UNIX/Linux terminal, specifying 
the organism as mouse:
